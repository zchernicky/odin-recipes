        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brigadeiro is a delicious Brazilian sweet that is very popular in the country. There is not a single childrens party without it. Otherwise, it is not a real party.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt to enhance the flavor</li>
            <li>Chocolate sprinkles or any other you prefer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a plate with butter and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium non-stick pan, combine the condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder in medium heat and mix it well.</li>
            <li>The mixture thickens after about 10-12 minutes, and once you can run your silicone spatula through the middle of it without it running back together for 2-3 seconds, it is done.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture onto the lightly greased plate and let it chill in the fridge for an hour.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prepare the candy cups and place the sprinkles in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, you are ready to roll the little balls. Lightly wet your hands, put a tablespoon of the chewy mixture on your hands, and roll into a small ball.</li>
            <li>Roll it over the sprinkles.</li>
            <li>Place the balls in the candy cups, and voila! Enjoy it!</li>
        </ol>
